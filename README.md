Data originally compiled for _Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960–2010_ by Charles Murray (Crown Forum, 2012). This app was inspired by the Washington Post's interactive feature _[Washington: A world apart](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/local/2013/11/09/washington-a-world-apart/)_. It has been augmented with unemployment data and congressional data from the sunshine project
